# Vehicle Make Recognition using YOLOv4 Object Detector

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction

A Python example for using [Spectrico's car brand classifier](http://spectrico.com/car-make-model-recognition.html). It consists of an object detector for finding the cars, and a classifier to recognize the brands of the detected cars. The object detector is an implementation of YOLOv4 (OpenCV DNN backend). YOLOv4 weights were downloaded from [AlexeyAB/darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights). The classifier is based on MobileNet v3 (Alibaba MNN backend).

The full version recognizes the make, model, and color of the vehicles. Here is a web demo to test it: [Vehicle Make and Model Recognition](http://spectrico.com/demo-car-mmr.html)

## Object Detection and Classification in images
This example takes an image as input, detects the cars using YOLOv4 object detector, crops the car images, resizes them to the input size of the classifier, and recognizes the brand of each car. The result is shown on the display and saved as output.jpg image file.


#### Usage
Use --help to see usage of car_brand_classifier_yolo4.py:
```
$ python car_brand_classifier_yolo4.py --image cars.jpg
```
```
$ python car_brand_classifier_yolo4.py [-h] [--yolo MODEL_PATH] [--confidence CONFIDENCE] [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--image]

required arguments:
  -i, --image              path to input image

optional arguments:
  -h, --help               show this help message and exit
  -y, --yolo MODEL_PATH    path to YOLO model weight file, default yolo-coco
  --confidence CONFIDENCE  minimum probability to filter weak detections, default 0.5
  --threshold THRESHOLD    threshold when applying non-maxima suppression, default 0.3
```

## Dependencies
  pip install numpy
  
  pip install opencv-python
  
  pip install MNN
  
  If you use Windows, the OpenCV package is recommended to be installed from: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

  yolov4.weights must be downloaded from [https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights) and saved in folder yolov4
